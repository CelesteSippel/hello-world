       <h4>What is Roller Derby?</h4>
         <p>Contrary to popular belief there's more to the sport that a bunch of women fighting while skating around in fishnet stockings. Roller derby is acutally a tactical sport with a rulebook longer than most professional sports.A bout is divided into two periods. Each period is divided into two-minute jams in which each team fields five players. Among the five are a jammer, a pivot lockers. The jammers start behind the rest of the pack and their goal is to lap the pack as many times as they can. The teams try to help their jammer through the pack while trying to stop the oppsing jammer. This can be done with full body contact hits but no douchebag moves like elbows, headbutting, tripping and so forth are not alllowed.</p>
